This is a simple calculator for runners to determine how long it will take to run a distance in miles. First, ask the user how far they will run. Next, ask the user to enter the desired pace in minutes per mile. Then, calculate how long it will take the user to complete the run, then print the results. For time, use minutes in decimal, for example 7 minutes and 30 seconds would be entered (and displayed) as 7.5.
